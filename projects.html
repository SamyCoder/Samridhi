                            <h2>This Personal Webpage</h2>
                            <p>
                                Implemented this personal webpage in Jekyll using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been made accessible for people with any kind of color blindness
                                including Protanopia, Deuteranopes, Tritanopes, and even Monochromacy commonly known as complete color blindness. This was the motivation behind creating the
                                webpage in grey scale, using larger font family and sizes, using common icons and patterns, distinguishing sections clearly, and providing ease for navigation.

                                Implemented a spacecraft game in Unity. Used good software practices like encapsulation and code reusability. 
                                The concept of separation of concerns, object pooling, and flyweight pattern has also been leveraged. 
                                Contains enemy bullets and boss feature, a scoring system, level system, and it looks beautiful!
