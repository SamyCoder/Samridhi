                            <p>
                                Implemented a mirror server world online. Went through the entire process of design and implementation for this metaverse 
                                including ideation, user surveys, observations, prototyping, front-end, and back-end implementation. This is a 3D art gallery multi 
                                collaborative environment hosted on a web server. The models are x3d and gltf, and the back-end development has mostly been done in NodeJS 
                                and JavaScript. Here is the github link:

                                This project is an online web pantry app that allows users to keep track of their pantry items and nutrition. There is also an easy and insightful graphical 
                                representation of pantry data for the users. MySQL, NodeJS, JavaScript, and ejs have been used. Here is the github link (does not have database information):

                            <p>
                                Implemented this personal webpage in Jekyll using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been made accessible for people with any kind of color blindness
                                including Protanopia, Deuteranopes, Tritanopes, and even Monochromacy commonly known as complete color blindness. This was the motivation behind creating the
                                webpage in grey scale, using larger font family and sizes, using common icons and patterns, distinguishing sections clearly, and providing ease for navigation.

                                Implemented a spacecraft game in Unity. Used good software practices like encapsulation and code reusability. 
                                The concept of separation of concerns, object pooling, and flyweight pattern has also been leveraged. 
                                Contains enemy bullets and boss feature, a scoring system, level system, and it looks beautiful!

                            <p>
                                Designed a working prototype for a hiking app. Used proper HCI principles including wireframes, storyboards,
                                and the systematic cycle of design, analyze, prototype, and evaluate. Went through several iterations of ideation, design, and performed user
                                evaluations as a group. Check out the final product here:
