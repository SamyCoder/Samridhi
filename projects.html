                            <p>
                                The goal was to improve automatic license plate recognition by finding the right pipeline and understanding what helps the model
                                specifically for low quality input images from pedestrian cameras. Tried to improve the accuracy of existing models with different combinations of OCR, super resolution,
                                and preprocessing to see which one performed the best.
                                Best Performing Model was: YOLOv7 for vehicle and LP object detection + Real-ESRGAN and OpenCV for image preprocessing to cropped LP images
                                + Fine Tuned EasyOCR model for character recognition on the UFPR-ALPR dataset

                            <p>
                                Analyzed how debias are the Mixture of Expert models compared to Bert. The Debiasing techniques used were SentenceDebias and Iterative NullSpace Projection INLP.
                                The datasets used were SEAT and GLUE dataset. Evaluation was done by the Sentence Encoder Association Test across gender, race, and religion. 
                                Switch transformer was first fine tuned on the GLUE dataset before adding any bias and measuring its prediction power. This project's goal was to 
                                evaluate models biasness and understand more what methods can be taken to make models less biased such that their prediction ability is not affected.
                                Skills: Hugging Face, Google Switch Transformer, Mixture of Expert models

                            <h2>Pandemic Simulator</h2>
                            <p>
                                Suggested improvement on the existing Pandemic Simulator project by Dr. Peter Stone in "Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of COVID-19 
                                Mitigation Policies" by suggesting to add the concept of job flexibility into the simulator. Modeled this parameter into the simulator and tested
                                how the infection rates and hospitalization curves changes based on stay at home restrictions and analyzed using the models response, 
                                the benefits of having hybrid or work from home models. These type of simulator can be helpful for policy makers to weigh the pros and cons
                                by seeing the impact before actually changing the policies.

                            <p>
                                Implemented a mirror server world online. Went through the entire process of design and implementation for this metaverse 
                                including ideation, user surveys, observations, prototyping, front-end, and back-end development. This is a multi-collaborative 3D art gallery 
                                environment hosted on a web server. x3d and gltf models have been used, and the back-end development has mostly been done in NodeJS 
                                and JavaScript. Here is the github link:

                                This project is an online web pantry app that allows users to keep track of their pantry items and nutrition. There is also an easy and insightful graphical 
                                representation of pantry data for the users. MySQL, NodeJS, JavaScript, and ejs have been used. Here is the github link (does not have database information):

                            <p>
                                Implemented this personal webpage in Jekyll using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been made accessible for people with any kind of color blindness
                                including Protanopia, Deuteranopes, Tritanopes, and even Monochromacy commonly known as complete color blindness. This was the motivation behind creating the
                                webpage in grey scale, using larger font family and sizes, using common icons and patterns, distinguishing sections clearly, and providing ease for navigation.

                                Designed a working prototype for a hiking app. Used proper HCI principles including wireframes, storyboards,
                                and the systematic cycle of design, analyze, prototype, and evaluate. Went through several iterations of ideation, design, and performed user
                                evaluations as a group. Check out the final product here:
